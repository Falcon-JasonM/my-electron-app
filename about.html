            <h2>About Jason Melick</h2>
            <p>
                I hold a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering. During my time at the University of Wyoming, I fell in love with designing and building mechatronic devices and coding.
                I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. My work involves a combination of development and operations, primarily maintaining and updating existing code. I'm eager to expand my skillset and delve deeper into development.
            </p>
            <p>
                This blog serves as a learning platform for me. I'll be sharing my progress and insights as I explore new skills. I hope you find it engaging and informative!
