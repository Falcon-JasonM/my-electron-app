            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>I hold a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering. During my time at the University of Wyoming, I fell in love with designing and building mechatronic devices and coding.<br>
                I am currently working as a Software Design Engineer at a company called J.P. Morgan Chase & Co (you may have heard of them?). I am working on a team that does a combination of development and operations.<br>
                My work with JPMC has been very rewarding, but at this point mainly involves maintaining and updating existing code. I am looking to expand my skillset and learn more about the development side of things.<br><br>

                This blog is a scratchpad for me to learn and practice new skills. I will be posting about my progress as I learn new things. I hope you enjoy!</p>
